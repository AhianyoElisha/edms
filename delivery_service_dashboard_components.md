- Revenue tracking with currency formatting
- Available vehicles count
- Active drivers count
- Responsive grid layout (6 cards total)
- Loading state with shimmer effects
- Consistent icon usage with Remix Icons

### 2. VehicleStatus (`/src/views/dashboards/VehicleStatus.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Real-time fleet monitoring and vehicle status tracking
**Features:**
- Fleet overview statistics (active, available, maintenance, unavailable)
- Individual vehicle status cards with detailed information
- Vehicle type icons (truck, van, motorcycle, bicycle)
- Status-based color coding
- Battery level monitoring for electric vehicles
- Driver assignment tracking
- Location updates
- Last update timestamps
- Responsive design with grid layout

### 3. DriverPerformance (`/src/views/dashboards/DriverPerformance.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Driver performance monitoring and top performer rankings
**Features:**
- Performance summary statistics (top rated, on trip, available)
- Top 5 performers ranking with position badges
- Star rating system with precision decimals
- Completion rate progress bars
- On-time delivery rate tracking
- Today's earnings and monthly totals
- Driver status indicators (active, offline, on-trip)
- Avatar support with fallback initials
- Vehicle type association
- Performance metrics visualization

### 4. PackageTrackingWidget (`/src/views/dashboards/PackageTrackingWidget.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Real-time package tracking and status monitoring
**Features:**
- Advanced search functionality (tracking number, sender, recipient)
- Expandable package timeline view
- Multi-step delivery status tracking
- Stepper component for delivery progress
- Driver information display
- Package details (type, weight, locations)
- Estimated delivery times
- Real-time location updates
- Status-based color coding
- Interactive timeline with completion states

### 5. TripSummary (`/src/views/dashboards/TripSummary.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Trip management and monitoring dashboard
**Features:**
- Summary statistics (active trips, revenue, packages, delivered)
- Tabbed interface (Active, Scheduled, Completed trips)
- Trip progress tracking with completion percentages
- Revenue and fuel cost tracking
- Distance and route information
- Driver and vehicle assignment
- Real-time status updates
- ETA and actual arrival times
- Package delivery progress
- Currency formatting for financial data

## Dashboard Integration

### Updated `DashboardContent.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Removed non-existent component imports (DeliveryOverview, PackageStatistics, RouteEfficiency, DeliveryStatistics)
- Added imports for all new components
- Updated component props to match new data structure
- Reorganized grid layout for better component placement
- Maintained existing driver performance cards functionality
- Preserved month/year selector functionality
- Updated data props to match expected component interfaces

**New Layout Structure:**
```
Row 1: DeliveryOverviewCards (full width)
Row 2: VehicleStatus (50%) + PackageTrackingWidget (50%)  
Row 3: Driver Performance Cards (dynamic based on data)
Row 4: TripSummary (50%) + DriverPerformance (50%)
Row 5: ActivityTimeline (full width)
Row 6: UserTable (full width)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Design Patterns Used
- **Material-UI Components:** Consistent usage of MUI components (Card, Grid, Typography, Chip, etc.)
- **Custom Avatar Component:** Leveraged existing CustomAvatar with object-fit styling
- **Color System:** Used application's ThemeColor type for consistent coloring
- **Loading States:** Implemented Shimmer components for loading states
- **Icon System:** Remix Icons for consistent iconography
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first responsive grid layouts

### TypeScript Integration
- **Strong Typing:** All components use proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Props Validation:** Defined clear prop types for all components
- **Optional Props:** Proper optional prop handling with fallbacks
- **Type Safety:** Full type safety throughout component hierarchy

### Data Structure Assumptions
Components expect data in the following structure:
```typescript
// Package Stats
packageStats: {
  active: number
  delivered: number
  packages: PackageTrackingType[]
}

// Trip Stats  
tripStats: {
  active: number
  revenue: number
  trips: TripSummaryType[]
}

// Vehicle Stats
vehicleStats: {
  available: number
  active: number
  maintenance: number
  unavailable: number
  vehicles: VehicleStatusType[]
}

// Driver Stats
driverStats: {
  active: number
  drivers: DriverPerformanceType[]
}
```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. API Integration
- Implement `getDeliveryDashboardData()` function in `/src/libs/actions/dashboard.actions.ts`
- Create data fetching functions for each component's data requirements
- Set up proper error handling and loading states

### 2. Type Definitions
- Add delivery service types to `/src/types/apps/deliveryTypes.ts`
- Define interfaces for all component data structures
- Export types for reuse across components

### 3. Route Updates
- Update application routing to reflect delivery service pages
- Remove mineral water specific routes from `/src/app/(dashboard)` structure
- Create new delivery service page routes

### 4. Navigation Dictionary
- Update navigation dictionary with delivery service terminology
- Translate menu items for internationalization
- Update permission mappings for delivery service roles

### 5. Testing
- Add unit tests for all new components
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- Verify data prop handling and error states

## File Locations
All components created in: `/src/views/dashboards/`
- `DeliveryOverviewCards.tsx`
- `VehicleStatus.tsx` 
- `DriverPerformance.tsx`
- `PackageTrackingWidget.tsx`
- `TripSummary.tsx`

Updated file: `/src/app/(dashboard)/(apps)/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx`

## Dependencies Used
- **@mui/material:** All MUI components and styling
- **@mui/lab:** Timeline, Stepper, and TabPanel components
- **@core/components:** CustomAvatar, OptionMenu
- **@core/types:** ThemeColor type definitions
- **@/utils:** getInitials utility function
- **classnames:** Dynamic className handling
- **React:** Hooks (useState) for component state management

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready dashboard system for the delivery service application with comprehensive monitoring capabilities and user-friendly interfaces.
