# Manifest Submission Workflow Improvements

## Problem Fixed
Previously, users could submit a manifest as "delivered" without first marking which specific packages were delivered. This caused issues because:
1. The checkboxes disappeared once the manifest was marked as delivered
2. There was no way to track which specific packages were delivered vs missing
3. Users could skip the important step of verifying individual packages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enforced Workflow Order**
The manifest can now only be submitted after at least one package has been marked as delivered:

```typescript
// Check if at least one package has been marked as delivered
const hasDeliveredPackages = packages.some((pkg: any) => pkg.status === 'delivered')
const hasUnprocessedPackages = packages.some((pkg: any) => pkg.status !== 'delivered' && pkg.status !== 'missing')

// Can only submit if: has proof, has at least one delivered package, and not already delivered
const canSubmit = hasProofImage && hasDeliveredPackages && !isDelivered
```

### 2. **Clear User Guidance**

#### Info Banner
When proof of delivery is uploaded but no packages are marked yet:
```
ℹ️ Select and mark packages as delivered before submitting the manifest
```

#### Tooltip on Submit Button
The submit button now shows helpful tooltips explaining why it's disabled:
- "Upload proof of delivery first" - when no proof image
- "Mark at least one package as delivered in the Packages tab" - when no packages marked
- "Ready to submit" - when all requirements met

### 3. **Enhanced Confirmation Dialog**
When submitting the manifest, users now see:
- Count of delivered packages
- Count of remaining packages (will be marked as missing)
- Clear summary of what will happen

Example:
```
Summary:
• Delivered: 8 package(s)
• Remaining: 2 package(s) (will be marked as missing)

This action will finalize the manifest and update the trip checkpoint.
```

### 4. **Submit Button Always Visible**
The button is now always visible but **disabled** until requirements are met, making it clear what needs to be done.

## Workflow Steps (Enforced)

1. ✅ **Upload Proof of Delivery** 
   - Take/upload delivery proof image
   - Checkboxes become enabled

2. ✅ **Mark Individual Packages** (REQUIRED)
   - Go to Packages tab
   - Select packages that were delivered
   - Click "Mark as Delivered"
   - Submit button becomes enabled

3. ✅ **Submit Manifest**
   - Click "Submit Manifest" button
   - Review summary in confirmation dialog
   - Confirm to finalize

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents Premature Submission** - Can't skip package verification
✅ **Better Data Quality** - Always know which packages were delivered vs missing
✅ **Clear Guidance** - Users always know what to do next
✅ **Transparent Process** - Summary shows exactly what will happen
✅ **Improved UX** - Disabled button with tooltip is better than hidden button

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `/src/views/edms/manifests/view/index.tsx`

### New Validations
1. `hasDeliveredPackages` - Ensures at least one package marked
2. `hasUnprocessedPackages` - Identifies packages that will be marked missing
3. `canSubmit` - Combines all requirements for submission

### New UI Components
1. Info banner for workflow guidance
2. Tooltip wrapper for submit button
3. Enhanced confirmation dialog with summary

### Imports Added
- `Tooltip` from `@mui/material/Tooltip`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload proof of delivery image
- [ ] Verify checkboxes are enabled after proof upload
- [ ] Verify submit button is disabled before marking packages
- [ ] Hover over disabled submit button to see tooltip
- [ ] Mark some packages as delivered
- [ ] Verify submit button becomes enabled
- [ ] Click submit and review summary dialog
- [ ] Confirm submission and verify manifest status updates
- [ ] Verify trip checkpoint is updated with package counts

## Migration Notes

**No database changes required** - This is purely a UI/UX improvement that enforces proper workflow without changing the data structure.

Existing manifests that were submitted without individual package tracking will continue to work. New submissions will follow the improved workflow.
